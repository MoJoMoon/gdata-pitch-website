GenAI Public Sentiment Research
We developed an ad campaign to gather public sentiment on GenAI’s influence on diversity inclusion in media.
After developing this prototype I continued to explore Generative Artificial Intelligence. 

And while at the Flatiron School’s Data Science 2020 cohort I was particularly interested in how this technology would impact diversity inclusion in media. 

So I worked on a system of models that could create life-like faces, and mask them on the faces of people in content. At that time this concept was a bit more novel and referred to as “deepfakes” so I developed a brief introduction to the idea for people to understand that I would like to share with you.

Could Generative AI promote Diversity Inclusion in Media?
83% say YES GenAI could increase the amount of diversity within media
₍₁₎
Overall 83% of the respondents felt that Generative AI could promote Diversity Inclusion in Media.

And I found this fascinating!That work was eye opening for me. I felt that there was something transformative on the horizon. Something that could bring more fairness into people's’ lives if used effectively. 

64.4% of respondents are interested in seeing
themselves in television and films.

I found that many people were interested in augmenting their favorite television shows and movies, with most people choosing to see themselves or loved ones represented in their content.

GenAI Public Sentiment Research
To learn more about the Jobs Issue, my team and I visited LA to observe the SAG/AFTRA strikes in real time around its 100th day.
These protests were being held at all of the large television and film studios in town. I came to understand that many were protesting the use of GenAI to replace human performers in film and tv. 
Others were against training AI performers on an artist’s previous work. 
Still some wanted to protect consent on how their data was used, as in changing their image or portraying it in scenarios they did not approve.

Using EEG to compare relaxation levels between video AI models and Reiki
Sora - OpenAI
Gen2 - Runway
Pika1.0 - PikaLabs
June 2024

Picalabs produced the most relaxing stimuli for the participant.
Biometric Research
For Beta, overall Reiki is associated with less activity than other conditions indicating that Reiki is most relaxing for the participant.
RunwayML is a bit more similar to Reiki
All three AI models perform comparably

We can compare the relaxation levels of different prompts. For this participant, Puppy Cloning was the most relaxing stimulus.
