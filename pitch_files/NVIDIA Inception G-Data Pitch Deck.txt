G-Data
Empowering Individuals to Own and Monetize Their DataFounder: Morgan Jones


Company Summary
G-Data Labs is an Atlanta-based AI and biometrics research lab focused on developing responsible AI frameworks​. Our mission is to revolutionize the AI training data market by creating a secure, consent-driven platform where people can own and monetize their data​. We empower people to profit from their personal data and improve their AI literacy, while ensuring AI developers access high-quality, ethically sourced training data​. 

The Problem
The Problem
• Economic Displacement & Livelihood Concerns – As AI technologies automate more roles, there is a risk of disenfranchising workers and disrupting traditional livelihoods. – Without mechanisms for people to earn from AI development, many may be left out of the economic benefits, exacerbating inequality.
• Data Bottleneck for AI Development – State-of-the-art models require vast amounts of high-quality data, yet the supply of new, reliable data is shrinking. – This data bottleneck threatens to slow AI progress, as developers struggle to source the fresh inputs needed to push innovation further.
• AI Literacy & Public Engagement – Many individuals remain intimidated by AI and lack the support or education to understand its benefits and applications.


The Problem
Data Privacy & Exploitation Concerns: AI systems today often rely on personal data collected without clear consent, leading to privacy violations and public distrust. Individuals have little control over or compensation from when their data is used to train AI.
AI Bias & Misuse: Biased training datasets can produce unfair, discriminatory AI outcomes. There is a real risk of AI systems perpetuating biases or being misused, undermining their reliability and social acceptance.
Economic Displacement: As AI and automation advance, many workers fear job loss and economic displacement without alternative ways to participate in the AI-driven economy. The benefits of AI innovation are not broadly shared, fueling inequality and backlash against AI adoption.



The Solution
Consent-Driven Data Marketplace: We are launching an innovative platform where people can securely contribute their data for AI training and get paid for it. By rewarding people for their data, we create economic opportunities and ensure a sustainable supply of fresh, high-quality data for AI developers​. This consent-based data marketplace turns personal data into a personal asset, empowering users while easing the data bottleneck in AI development.
Responsible AI Research: G-Data Labs conducts ongoing research into the psychological and socio-economic impacts of AI​. These insights continuously refine our ethical frameworks for AI. By studying human-AI interaction, we ensure our platform’s data is used in ways that ultimately benefit people and reduce harmful outcomes.
AI Literacy & Community Engagement: We run education initiatives like our “Generate Data Campaign” to demystify AI for the public​. Through workshops and a Mobile AI Lab a traveling AI education and data collection hub, we teach communities how to use AI tools and safely contribute data. This boosts AI literacy and builds a community of engaged, informed data contributors​. By making AI more accessible, we grow our user base and ensure people displaced by automation can re-skill and earn income in the AI economy.

What Makes Us Unique
Our approach combines technology, ethics, and community in a way that competitors can’t easily replicate. First, we practice responsible data sourcing with explicit user consent – every data contributor knows and agrees to how their data will be used. Second, we leverage advanced privacy and biometric security to safeguard data integrity (including cutting-edge facial recognition and fingerprint ID for user verification)​. Third, we are research-driven, continuously studying AI’s social impact to inform our product design and ensure fair, bias-mitigated data practices. Finally, this holistic integration of consent, privacy tech, and ethics research gives us a competitive edge that is hard to copy – a human-centric AI data ecosystem built on trust and transparency. We transform personal data into a personal asset while upholding the highest standards of responsible AI.

What Makes Us Unique
What Makes You Unique
• Responsible Data Sourcing with Engager Consent – Unlike competitors who rely on opaque data practices, our platform empowers users by ensuring every data contribution is made with clear, active consent. – This consent-centric approach builds trust and creates a community-driven data ecosystem that directly rewards contributors.
• Advanced Privacy & Data Integrity Technologies – We leverage cutting-edge biometric security and proprietary AI algorithms to safeguard data and maintain its quality. – This robust technological foundation sets us apart from traditional data brokers and less rigorous data marketplaces.
• Research-Driven Insights – Our ongoing studies examine the socio-economic and psychological impacts of AI, enabling us to continuously refine our responsible data usage model. – These research efforts ensure that our training data not only fuels innovation but does so in a way that benefits society.
• Competitive Edge & Difficult Replicability – The unique integration of a consent-centric framework, advanced technology, and rigorous research creates an ecosystem that is hard to replicate. – While competitors may offer isolated solutions, our holistic approach differentiates us and establishes a sustainable competitive advantage.

Current Traction
Pilot Engagements & PoCs: We have launched several pilot programs and proof-of-concept projects with early adopters. These pilots with strategic partners validate our platform’s functionality and our consent-based data sourcing model​. Early participants have successfully contributed data and received compensation, demonstrating the marketplace mechanics and real-world interest.
Market Research & Community Outreach: Extensive market research with groups affected by AI automation confirmed a strong need for alternative income sources through data monetization​. Our recent community workshop for middle schoolers on generative AI and data literacy was full with enthusiastic feedback, underscoring public interest in AI education​. These activities not only spread awareness but also build a pipeline of future users who are eager to engage with our platform.
Early Feedback & Validation: Initial users and pilot participants have given very positive feedback on G-Data’s platform. Testers praise the intuitive design, robust security (biometric login and consent controls), and the innovative concept of getting paid for one’s data​. This early validation has helped refine our user experience and provides confidence in product–market fit. We are also in discussions with additional industry partners and academic institutions to expand our reach, highlighting strong future demand.


Funding
Funding
• How much money have you currently raised? – We’ve bootstrapped our operations to date with approximately $20k in funding.
